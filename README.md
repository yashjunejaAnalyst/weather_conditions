**Project title -** Comparative Analysis of Weather and Solar Energy Patterns Between Los Angeles and Oakland

**Project objective -** To analyze and compare the yearly and seasonal weather conditions, solar energy availability and related environmental factors between Los Angeles and Oakland, in order to understand differences in climate behavior identify periods of severe weather risks and evaluate solar energy potential in both cities.

**Project approach -** 
Data Collection: Gather historical weather data for both cities, including temperature, precipitation, UV index, solar radiation, humidity, cloud cover, dew point, visibility, and severe weather flags.

Temporal Analysis: Break down data by time of day, month and season to identify patterns and peak periods for solar energy and weather severity.

Comparative Metrics: Calculate and compare average temperatures, precipitation totals, solar energy metrics (daily and monthly), UV index exceedance rates and frequency of severe weather conditions.

Correlation Study: Examine relationships such as dew point vs. precipitation and cloud cover vs. visibility to understand their impact on local weather and solar energy availability.

Visualization: Use charts and graphs to visually communicate differences and trends across both cities.

**Outcome -** -
A detailed report outlining the climatic differences between Los Angeles and Oakland throughout the year.

Identification of peak solar energy times and UV index periods for optimized solar energy use.

Insights into months/seasons with heightened severe weather risks for better preparedness.

Quantitative comparison of humidity, cloud cover, visibility, and their effects on weather conditions.

Actionable recommendations for solar energy projects, urban planning, or public safety measures based on weather risk patterns.
